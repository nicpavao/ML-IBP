Reducing Feynman Integrals with Transformer Neural Networks

This project explores the use of Transformer Neural Networks
in reducing Feynman integrals trained in data generated with
IBP relations. The setup is as follows:

model.py 
- model architecture and hypers
train.dat
- training data generated with FIRE
test.dat
- holdout data to test model performance
train.py 
- training module
test.py
- testing module
